# ScrumDevils-SER_515

We are developing an application named 'Figit', which is a GitHub Analyzer. 

Students, in teams, work on a project and use GitHub, as a repository where they develop the application in collaboration. Our application analyzes this collaboration and give a Graphical Representation about the contributions made by each member.

This Application will be a common platform where the Grader (one who will judge the team projects on GitHub) will be able to easily access and move in between different GitHub projects and analyze the performance of each member of the Project using Pie Chart and Bar Graphs as the metrics.

To develop this application, we are using the following technologies:
1. React Framework - This will create the User Interface for the Web Application.
2. Django Rest Framework - This will provide REST APIs to ensure smooth data flow between the Database and UI.
3. Python - This will be used to create scripts that will call GitHub APIs to get the actual data of repositories.
